# Voice Generator Interface

## The website has now changed. For up-to-date information and to use the new web dashboard, please visit our new site: [https://vcroles.com](https://vcroles.com)































When you create a new voice channel generator [using a /generator create command](commands/commands/voice-channel-generators.md#generator-create) (with the `user_editable` flag set to True), a text channel will be created alongside the voice channel.

An interface message will get sent to this channel:

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are a premium user and have multiple voice generators per server, you only need one interface channel which covers all the generators, however you can make more if wanted.
{% endhint %}

Pressing any of these buttons will change the mentioned aspect of your generated voice channel.



The 'Permit Roles/Members' select will give roles/members the permission to join your voice channel. Similarly, the 'Restrict Roles/Members' removes those role/members permissions to join your voice channel.



There is also a selection of commands that you can use instead of using the buttons/reactions in the interface channel. A full run-through of these commands can be found on the [interface commands](commands/commands/interface-commands.md) page.
