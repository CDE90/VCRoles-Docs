# Voice Generator Interface

When you create a new voice channel generator ([using /generator create](commands/commands/voice-channel-generators.md#generator-create)), a text channel will be created alongside the voice channel.

An interface message will get sent to this channel:

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1).png>)

Pressing any of these buttons will change the mentioned aspect of your generated voice channel.

****

There is also a selection of commands that you can use instead of using the buttons/reactions in the interface channel. A full run-through of these commands can be found on the [interface commands](commands/commands/interface-commands.md) page.
