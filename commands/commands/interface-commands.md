# Interface Commands

Along with the methods of editing your private/generated voice channel mentioned [here](../../voice-generator-interface.md), there is also a selection of commands which perform the same jobs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note for all these commands (except claim), you need to be the owner of the voice channel.
{% endhint %}

## /interface lock

Locks your generated voice channel - stops other members from being able to join the channel

## /interface unlock

Unlocks your generated voice channel - allowing other members to join your voice channel

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

## /interface hide

Hides your generated voice channel - hides your voice channel from the channel list

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)

## /interface show

Shows your generated voice channel - shows your generated voice channel in the channel list

## /interface increase

Increases the member limit for your voice channel

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (75).png>)

## /interface decrease

Decreases the member limit for your voice channel. Decreasing it to 0 removes the member limit.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (87).png>)

## /interface limit

Sets the member limit for your voice channel to the number specified. Setting it to 0 removes the member limit.

## /interface rename

Renames your voice channel.

## /interface claim

Claims the voice channel (if the owner has left) - this makes you the new owner, so you can use all other commands.

## /interface invite

Invites a user to your voice channel. The user will receive a DM, letting them know, and the channel permissions will be updated to let them in (so if your channel is locked and you invite them, they are allowed to join)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note this is a [Premium Only](https://cde90.gumroad.com/l/vcroles) feature
{% endhint %}

## /interface permit

This command sends a select, which allows the user to select members and/or roles which they want to allow to join their voice channel.

## /interface restrict

Like the permit command, except it removes the member/roles permissions to join.
