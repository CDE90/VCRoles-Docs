# Category Linking

Category linking allows you to automatically give members a role(s) when they join any voice channel in a category, and remove the role(s) once they leave.&#x20;

One great use of Category Linking is with the Voice Channel Generator.

## /category link

The category link command is used to create a link between all channels in the category and a role.

## /category unlink

The category unlink command is the opposite of the category link command, and removes a category-role link.

## /category suffix \[add/remove]

This command makes it so that when you join any voice channel in a given category, a suffix is added to your username, and removed when you leave the channel.

E.g. your name before joining could be: `Owner | Mr R3spect` and when you join: `Owner | Mr R3sp3ct OS` with OS being the prefix added (in this case meaning online staff)
