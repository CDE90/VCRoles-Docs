# Category Linking

Category linking allows you to automatically give members a role(s) when they join any voice channel in a category, and remove the role(s) once they leave.&#x20;

One great use of Category Linking is with the Voice Channel Generator.

## /catlink

The catlink command is used to create a link between all channels in the category and a role.

## /catunlink

The catunlink command is the opposite of the catlink command, and removes a category-role link.
