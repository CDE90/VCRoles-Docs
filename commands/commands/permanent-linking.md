# Permanent Linking

Permanent linking is used when you want a member to keep the role(s) they were given when they joined the voice channel.

This is useful for creating a unique user verification system for your server to prevent raids, by forcing all new members to join the voice channel first.

## /permlink

This command creates a link between a channel and a role, as specified above.
