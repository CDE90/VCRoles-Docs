# Permanent Linking

Permanent linking is used when you want a member to keep the role(s) they were given when they joined the voice channel.

This is useful for creating a unique user verification system for your server to prevent raids, by forcing all new members to join the voice channel first.

## /permanent link

This command creates a link between a channel and a role, as specified above.

## /permanent unlink

Removes a 'permanent' role link.

## /permanent suffix \[add/remove]

This command makes it so that when you join the voice channel, a suffix is added to your username, and remains when you leave the channel.

E.g. your name before joining could be: `Owner | Mr R3spect` and when you join: `Owner | Mr R3sp3ct OS` with OS being the prefix added (in this case meaning online staff)
