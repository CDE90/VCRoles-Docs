# Stage Linking

Stage channel linking allows you to automatically give members a role(s) when they join a stage channel, and remove the role(s) once they leave.&#x20;

One great use of Stage Linking is creating private 'Stage Discussion' channels, where only people in the stage channel can send messages, and discuss the conversation.

## /stagelink

The stagelink command is used to create a 'stage channel-role' link. Like voice channel links, you can create multiple role links per channel.

## /stageunlink

The opposite of the stagelink command, this command removes a channel-role link.
