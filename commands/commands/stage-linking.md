# Stage Linking

Stage channel linking allows you to automatically give members a role(s) when they join a stage channel, and remove the role(s) once they leave.&#x20;

One great use of Stage Linking is creating private 'Stage Discussion' channels, where only people in the stage channel can send messages, and discuss the conversation.

## /stage link

The stage link command is used to create a 'stage channel-role' link. Like voice channel links, you can create multiple role links per channel.

## /stage unlink

The opposite of the stage link command, this command removes a channel-role link.

## /stage suffix \[add/remove]

This command makes it so that when you join a stage channel, a suffix is added to your username, and removed when you leave the channel.

E.g. your name before joining could be: `Owner | Mr R3spect` and when you join: `Owner | Mr R3sp3ct OS` with OS being the prefix added (in this case meaning online staff)
