# All Linking

'All' linking allows you to automatically give members a role(s) when they join any voice channel, and remove the role(s) once they leave.&#x20;

All linking will make it so the bot will automatically give the set roles when a member joins any voice channel (that the bot has permission to see). You can create exception channels, which are channels where members aren't given the 'All linked' roles in.

## /all link

This creates a link between all channels in the server and a role.

![all link command](<../../.gitbook/assets/alllink.png>)

## /all unlink

The opposite of the all link command, this command removes the link between all channels and the specified role.

![all unlink command](<../../.gitbook/assets/allunlink.png>)

## /all exception add

This command is used to create an exception to the 'All linked' roles. When a member joins the exception channel, they won't be given the role that's linked to all channels.

![all exception command](<../../.gitbook/assets/allexcept.png>)

## /all exception remove

The opposite of the all exception add command, this removes the all-link exception from the channel.&#x20;

## /all suffix \[add/remove]

This command makes it so that when you join any voice channel (which the bot can see), a suffix is added to your username, and removed when you leave.

E.g. your name before joining could be: `Owner | Mr R3spect` and when you join: `Owner | Mr R3sp3ct OS` with OS being the prefix added (in this case meaning online staff)
