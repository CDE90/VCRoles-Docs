# All Linking

'All' linking allows you to automatically give members a role(s) when they join any voice channel, and remove the role(s) once they leave.&#x20;

All linking will make it so the bot will automatically give the set roles when a member joins any voice channel (that the bot has permission to see). You can create exception channels, which are channels where members aren't given the 'All linked' roles in.

## /alllink

This creates a link between all channels in the server and a role.

## /allunlink

The opposite of the alllink command, this command removes the link between all channels and the specified role.

## /allexception

This command is used to create an exception to the 'All linked' roles. When a member joins the exception channel, they won't be given the role that's linked to all channels.

## /allexceptionremove

The opposite of the allexception command, this removes the all-link exception from the channel.&#x20;
