# Permissions

## Required Permissions

The bot needs a few permissions to work. These permissions should be automatically applied if you use this [invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=775025797034541107\&permissions=300944400\&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

* Create Slash/Application Commands
* Manage Roles - to add/remove user roles
* Manage Channels - to create/delete voice generator channels
* Read Messages - to see your commands
* Send Messages - to respond to commands
* Connect - to join voice channels
* Speak - to read TTS messages in voice channels
* Mute Members - for Voice Admin
* Deafen Members - for Voice Admin
* Move Members - for voice generators

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the bot doesn't give a role when a member joins, you should make sure the 'VC Roles' role is above the role you want it to give.
{% endhint %}

## Troubleshooting Steps

If you are experiencing issues with the bot not responding, try giving the bot `Administrator` permissions temporarily, and if the bot still doesn't work, join our [support server](https://discord.gg/yHU6qcgNPy), where we'll be happy to help!
